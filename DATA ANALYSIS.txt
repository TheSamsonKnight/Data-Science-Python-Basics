			DATA ANALYSIS W/ PYTHON
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
WHY DATA ANALYSIS
-DATA IS EVERYWHERE
-DATA ANALYSIS/SCIENCE HELPS US ANSWER QUUESTIONS FROM DATA
	-INSIGHT/INFO FROM RA DATA
-DATA DOESNT NECESSARILY = INFORMATION
-DATA ANALYSIS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN:
	-DISCOVERING USEFUL INFORMATION
	-ANSWERING QUESTIONS
	-PREDICTING FUTURE TRENDS
-ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF DATA

Define the Business Problem: Look at the data and make some high-level decision on what kind of analysis should be done

Import and Export Data in Python: How to import data from multiple data sources using the Pandas library and how to export files into different formats.

Analyze Data in Python: How to do some introductory analysis in Python using functions like dataframe.head() to view the first few lines of the dataset, dataframe.info() to view the column names and data types.
