DATA VISUALIZATION
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
A WAY TO SHOW A NEED TO LEARN HOW TO SHOW COMPLEX DATA IN A FORM THAT IS GRAPHICAL AND EASY TO FOLLOW
	-FOR EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
	-COMMUNICATE DATA CLEARLY
	-SHARE UNBIASED REPRESENTATION OF DATA
	-USE THEM TO SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS TO DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS

-BEST PRACTICES WHEN CREATING VIZ:
	-LESS IS MORE EFFECTIVE
	-LESS IS MORE ATTRACTIVE
	-LESS IS MORE IMPACTIVE

-EFFECTIVE, ATTRACTIVE, IMPACTIVE

MAT PLOT LIB

LIBRARY FOR DATA VIZ IN PYTHON
	-MADE BY JOHN HUNTER, NEUROLOGIST WORKING ON ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY

ARCHITECTURE:
-BACKEND LAYER: 
	-FIGURE CANVAS: DEFINES THE AREAS INTO WHICH THE FIGURE IS DRAWN 
	-RENDERER: KNOWS HOW TO DRAW ON THE FIGURE CANVAS
	-EVENT: HANDLES USER INPUTS SUCH AS KEYBOARDS STROKES AND MOUSE CLICKS
-ARTIST LAYER:
	-SYNTAX HEAVY, MEANT FOR DEVS
	-ARTIST: KNOWS HOW TO USE THE RENDERER TO DRAW ON THE CANVAS; CREATES AN ARTIST INSTANCE
		-ARTIST OBJECTS: PRIMITIVE:LINE2D, RECTANGLE, CIRCLE, TEXT
		-COMPOSITE: AXIS, TICK, AXES, FIGURE
		-EACH COMPOSITE ARTIST MAY CONTAIN OTHER COMPOSITE ARTISTS AS WELL AS PRIMITIVE ARTIST
		
-SCRIPTING LAYER: 
	-COMPROMISED MAINLY OF PYPLT, SCRIPTING INTERFACE THATS LIGHTER THAN THE ARTIST LAYER
	-PYPLOT


-MAGIC FUNCTION: %, TO ENFORCE PLOTS TO BE RENDERED WITHIN THE BROWSER, YOU PASS INLINE AS BACKGROUND
	-CANNOT MODIFY A FIGURE ONCE RENDERED >>> GENERATE NEW PLOT
	-USE NOTEBOOK BACKEND: IF PLT FUNCTION IS CALLED, IT CHECKS IF ACTIVE FIGURE EXISTS AND 	FUNCTIONS CALLED WILL BE APPLIED TO THIS ACTIVE FIGURE
		-IF FIGURE DOESNT EXIST, RENDERS NEW FIGURE

PANDAS: ALREADY HAS A BUILT IN IMPLEMENTATION OF MATPLOTLIB
-CALL THE PLOT FUNCTION ON SERIES/DATAFRAME FOR PLOTTING
