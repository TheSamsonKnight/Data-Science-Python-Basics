JOIN OPERATOR
======================================================================================================
-COMBINES ROWS FROM TWO OR MORE TABLES, BASED ON RELATIONSHIP
-PRIMARY KEY: UNIQUELY IDS EACH ROW IN A TABLE
-FOREIGN KEY: REFERS TO A PRIMARY KEY OF ANOTHER TABLE

TYPES:
-INNER JOIN: DISPLAYS ONLY THE ROWS FROM TWO TABLES THAT HAVE MATCHING VALUE IN A COMMON COLUMN
	-USUALLY THE PRIMARY KEY OF ONE TABLE THAT EXISTS AS A FOREIGN KEY IN THE OTHER TABLE

-OUTER JOIN: RETURNS MATCHING ROWS, AND EVEN THE ROWS FROM ONE OR THE OTHER TABLE THAT DONT MATCH
	-LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN

A join combines the rows from two or more tables based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.

To combine data from three or more different tables, you simply add new joins to the SQL statement. 

There are two types of table joins: inner join and outer join; and three types of outer joins: left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join. 

The most common type of join is the inner join, which matches the results from two tables and returns only the rows that match.

You can use an alias as shorthand for a table or column name.

You can use a self-join to compare rows within the same table.

INNER JOIN
-ROWS THAT HAVE MATCHING VALUE DONT APPEAR IN THE RESULT
-CARTESIAN JOIN
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
OUTER JOIN
-LEFT OUTER JOIN: ALL ROWS FROM THE LEFT TABLE & ANY MATCHING ROWS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE
-RIGHT OUTER JOIN: ALL ROWS FROM THE RIFHT TABLE & ANY MATCHING ROWS FROM THE LEFT TABLE
	-returns all of the rows that an inner join returns and all the rows in the 2nd table that dont match in the 1st table
-FULL OUTER JOIN: ALL ROWS FROM BOTH TABLES
