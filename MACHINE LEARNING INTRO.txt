MACHINE LEARNING
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
-THE SUBFIELD OF COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT GIVES "COMPUTERS THE ABILITY TO LEARN WITHOUT BEING EXPLICITLY PROGRAMMED"
-ALLOWS US TO BUILD A MODEL THAT LOOKS AT ALL THE FEATURES SETS, AND THEIR CORRESPONDING TYPES AND LEARNS PATTERNS
	-OBJECT RECOGNITION
	-SUMMARIZATION
	-RECOMMENDATION, ETC

-MAJOR ML TEACHNIQUES:
	-REGRESSION/ESTIMATION: PREDICTING CONTINOUS VALUE
	-CLASSIFICATION: PREDICTING THE CLASS/CATEGORY OF A CASE
	-CLUSTERING: FINDING THE STRUCTURE OF DATA, SUMMARIZATION
	-ASSOCIATIONS: ASSOCIATING FREQUENT CO-OCCURING ITEMS/EVENTS
	-ANOMALY DETECTION: DISCOVERING ABNORMAL AND UNUSUAL CASES
	-SEQUENCE MINING: PREDICTING NEXT EVENTS, CLICK-STREAM (MARKOV MODEL, HMM)
	-DIMENSION REDUCTION: REDUCING THE SIZE OF DATA (PCA)
	-RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS: RECOMMENDING ITEMS

-AI COMPONENTS: MAKES COMPUTERS INTELLIGENT IN ORDER TO MIMIC THE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS OF HUMANS
	COMPUTER VISION
	LANGUAGE PROCESSING
	CREATIVITY
	SUMMARIZATION
-ML: BRANCH OF AI THAT COVERS THE STATISTICAL PART OF AI, TEACHS COMPUTER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BY LOOKING AT NUMEROUS EXAMPLES, LEARNING FROM THEM, USING THAT SAME EXPERIENCE TO SOLVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN NEW SITUATIONS
	CLASSIFICATION
	CLUSTERING
	NEURAL NETWORK
-DEEP LEARNING:VERY SPECIAL FIELD OF ML WHERE COMPUTERS CAN ACTUALLY LEARN AND MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN, INVOLVES A DEEPER LEVEL OF AUTOMATION IN COMPARISON WITH MOST ML ALGORITHMS
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
PYTHON LIBRARIES FOR ML
-NUM PY: MATH LIBRARY TO WORK WITH N-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS IN PYTHON
	COMPUTATIONS
-SCI PY: COLLECTION OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS AND DOMAIN SPECIFIC TOOLBOXES
	SIGNAL PROCESSING, OPTIMAZATION, STATISTICS, HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTATION
-MAT PLOT LIB: PLOTTING PACKAGES THAT PROVIDES GRAPHS
-PANDAS: HIGH LEVEL EASY TO USE DATA STUCTURES
	DATA IMPORTING, MANIPULATION, ANALYSIS, DATA STRUCTURES AND OPERATIONS FOR MANIPULATION 
-SCI KIT LEARN: COLLECTION OF ALGORITHMS AND TOOLS FOR ML
	CLASSIFICATION, REGRESSION, CLUSTERING
	WORKS WITH NUMPY AND SCIPY
	GREAT DOCUMENTATION
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
SUPERVISED VS UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

SUPERVISED LEARNING: TO OBSERVE AND DIRECT THE EXECUTION OF A TASK, PROJECT, OR ACTIVITY
	"TEACH THE MODEL" THEN WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE, IT CAN PREDICT UNKNOWN OR FUTURE INSTANCES
		TRAIN THE MODEL WITH DATA FROM A LABELED DATASET
	COLUMN-FEATURES, ROWS-ATTRIBUTES/OBSERVATION
	-TYPES OF SUPERVISED LEARNING TECHNIQUES:
		CLASSIFICATION: PROCESS OF PREDICTING DISCRETE CLASS LABELS/CATEGORIES
		REGRESSION: THE PROCESS OF PREDICTING CONTINUOUS VALUES

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: DONT SUPERVISE THE MODEL, BUT LET THE IT WORK ON ITS OWN TO DISCOVER INFORMATION NOT VISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE
	UNSUPERVISED ALGORITHM TRAINS ON THE DATASET AND DRAWS CONCLUSIONS ON UNLABELED DATA
	-TYPES OF UNSUPERVISED LEARNING TECHNIQUES:
		-DIMENSION REDUCTION: (FEATURE SELECTION) REDUCING REDUNDENT FEATURES TO MAKE CLASSIFICIATION EASIER
		-DENSITY ESTIMATION: EXPLORE DATA TO FIND SOME STRUCTURE WITHIN IT
		-MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS: MODELING TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE THEORY THAT IF YOU BUY CERTAIN GROUP OF ITEMS, YOUR MORE LIKELY TO BUY ANOTHER GROUP OF ITEMS
		-CLUSTERING: GROUPING OF DATA POINTS/OBJECTS THAT ARE SOMEHOW SIMILAR BY:
			DISCOVERING STRUCTURE, SUMMARIZATION, ANOMALY DETECTION

	SUPERVISED-----------------------------------------------------UNSUPERVISED
	-CLASSIFIES LABELED DATA			-FINDS PATTERNS FROM UNLABELED DATA
	-PREDICTS TRENDS USING PREVIOUS DATA		-HAS FEWER EVAL METHODS 
	-HAS MORE EVAL METHODS		
	-CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT				-LESS CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT
	CLASSIFICATION, REGRESSION			-CLUSTERING
