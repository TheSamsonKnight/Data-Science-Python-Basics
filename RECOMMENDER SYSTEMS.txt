RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
-CAPTURE THE PATTERN OF PPLS BEHAVIOR AND USE IT TO PREDICT WHAT ELSE THEY MIGHT WANT OR LIKE

PRO: 
-USERS GET BROADER EXPOSURE TO SERVICE OR PRODUCTS
-POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUAL USAGE OR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS/SERVICE
-PROVIDES BETTER EXPERIENCE

2 TYPES OF SYSTEMS:
-CONTENT BASED: "SHOW ME MORE OF THE SAME OF WHAT IVE LIKED BEFORE"
	-ATTEMPTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE USERS FAV ASPECTS ARE, THEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON ITEMS 	THAT SHARE THOSE ASPECTS
	-SIMILAR ITEMS
-COLLABORATIVE FILTERING: "TELL ME WHATS POPULAR AMONG MY NEIGHBOTS I ALSO MIGHT LIKE"
	-FINDS SIMILAR GROUPS OF USERS, PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON SIMILAR TASTES W/IN GROUP
	-SIMILAR PREFERENCES/USERS

IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS:
-MEMORY BASED:
	-USES THE ENTIRE USER-ITEM DATASET TO GENERATE A RECOMMENDATION
	-USES STAT TECHNIQUES TO APPROXIMATE USERS/ITEMS
		-PEARSON CORRELATION, COSINE SIMILARITY, EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE, ETC
-MODEL BASED:
	-DEVELOPS A MODEL OF USERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEARN THEIR PREFERENCES
	-MODELS CAN BE CREATED USING ML TECHNIQUES LIKE REGRESSION, CLUSTERING, CLASSIFICATION, ETC
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS

-RECOMMENDS ITEMS TO USERS BASED ON THEIR PROFILE
	-USERS PROFILE REVOLVES AROUND THEIR PREFERENCE AND TASTES
-SHAPED BASED ON USER RATINGS; INCLUDES THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT USER HAS CLICKED/LIKED ON DIFF ITEMS
-RECOMMENDATION PROCESS IS BASED ON THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THOSE ITEMS
	-SIMILARITY OF ITEMS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE SIMILARITY IN THE CONTENT OF THOSE ITEMS

-CREATE VECTOR OF USERS RATINGS (INPUT USER RATINGS)
-ENCODE THE ITEMS THROUGH ONE-HOT APPROACH (CREATE MATRIX BASED ON LIKES)
-COMBINED MATRIX TO SHOW DETAILED SIMILARITY (WEIGHTED GENRE MATRIX)
-SHAPE PROFILE OF ACTIVE USERS
-AGGREGRATE THE WEIGHTED GENRES, THEN NORMALIZE THEM TO FIND THE USER PROFILE
-REPEAT PROCESS FOR UNRATED MOVIES(POTENTIALLY RECOMMENDED MOVIES)
	-CREATES RECOMMENDATION LIST

============================================================================================================================================================================================================
COLLABORATIVE FILTERING

-BASED ON THE FACT THAT RELATIONSHIPS EXIST BETWEEN PPL INTEREST AND PRODUCTS
-MANY RECOMMDER SYSTEMS USE COLLABORATIVE FILTERING TO FIND THESE RELATIONSHIPS, AND GIVE AN ACCURATE RECOMMENDATION OF A PRODUCT THAT THE USER MIGHT LIKE OR BE INTERESTED IN

-USER BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING: BASED ON USERS NEIGHBORHOOD/SIMILARITY
-ITEM BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING: BASED ON SIMILARITY AMONG ITEMS

-ACTIVE USER FOR WHOM THE RECOMMENDATION IS AIMED
-ENGINE LOOKS FOR USERS WHO ARE SIMILAR(SHARE USERS RATING PATTERN)
	-BASED ON HISTORY, PREFERENCE, CHOICE WHEN USER IS SELECTING/BUY/WATCH/ENJOY SOMETHING
-USES RATING FROM SIMILAR USERS TO PREDICT THE POSSIBLE RATINGS BY ACTIVE USER FOR AN ITEM NOT PREVIOUSLY USED
	-TWO USERS WHO ARE NEIGHBORS IN TERMS OF INTERESTS, RECOMMEND TO ACTIVE USER OF NEIGHBORS 	INTERESTS

USER RATINGS MATRIX
-FIND OUT HOW SIMILAR THE ACTIVE USER IS TO OTHER USERS, FIND SIMILARITY
	-USE BOTH USERS ITEM RATING/PROXIMITY OF ACTIVE USERS TO OTHER USERS IN THE DATASET
-CREATE A WEIGHTED RATINGS MATRIX
	-COMPARE THE WEIGHTED RESULTS
	-CALCULATE THE POSSIBLE OPINION OF ACTIVE USER: MULTIPLY THE SIMILARITY WEIGHTS TO THE USER 		RATINGS >>> CREATES WEIGHTED RATINGS MATRIX
		-USERS NEIGHBORS OPINION FOR CANDIDATE ITEM FOR RECOMMENDATION
		-INCORPORATES THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHER USERS, GIVES MORE WEIGHT TO THE RATINGS OF THOSE 		USERS WHO ARE MORE SIMILAR TO THE ACTIVE USER
-GENERATE RECOMMENDATION MATRIX: AGGREGATE ALL OF THE WEIGHTED RATES

USER BASED:
-BASED ON USERS OF THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD

ITEM BASED:
-SIMILAR ITEMS BUILDS NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE BEHAVIOR OF USERS, NOT BASED ON CONTENTS
	-ITEMS IN NEIGHBORHOOD THAT A USER MIGHT PREFER

CHALLENGES:
	-DATA SPARSITY: LARGE DATASET OF USERS, USERS IN GENERAL RATE ONLY A LIMITED # OF ITEMS
		-CAN ONLY PREDICT SCORING OF AN ITEM IF THERE ARE OTHER USERS WHO HAVE RATED IT
		-MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH RATINGS IN THE USER ITEM DATASET
	-COLD START: DIFFICULT IN RECOMMENDATION TO NEW USERS OR NEW ITEMS
		-PROFILE DOESNT EXIST FOR THEM
		-NEW ITEM HASNT RECEIVED A RATING
	-SCALABILITY: INCREASE IN NUMBER OF USERS OR ITEMS
		-AS DATA EXPANDS, ALGORITHMS WOULD DROP IN PERFORMANCE
