TRIGGER
=====================================================================================================
*SQL code that automatically execute in response to events on a particular table

Advantages:
-forcing security approvals on the table/DB
-triggers check integrity of data
-counteracting invalid exchanges
-triggers handle errors
-useful for inspecting the data

Disadvantages:
-can be difficult to troubleshoot because they execute automatically in the DB
-can increase the overhead of the DB
-can only provide extended validations

Syntax:
Create Trigger Trigger-Name
(Before|After)
[insert|update|delete] on [table-name]
[for each row|for each colomn]
[Trigger-body]

ex:
Create Trigger sample_student
before INSERT
ON student
FOR EACH ROW
SET new.marks = new.marks+6;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
