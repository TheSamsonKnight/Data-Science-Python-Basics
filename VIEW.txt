VIEW
======================================================================================================
-AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF REPRESENTING DATA THAT EXISTS IN ONE OR MORE TABLES OR PRESENTATIONS
	-CAN INCLUDE ALL OR SOME OF THE (SPECIFIED)COLUMNS FROM ONE OR MORE BASE TABLES OR EXISTING VIEWS
	-ONCE CREATED, CAN BE QUERIED LIKE A TABLE
-CREATING A VIEW CREATES A NAMED SPECIFICATION OF A RESULTS TABLE >>> QUERIED AS TABLE
	-ONLY THE DEFINITION OF THE VIEW IS STORED, NOT THE DATA
	-THE DATA THE VIEW REPRESENTS IS STORED IN THE BASE TABLE, NOT BY THE VIEW ITSELF
	-DYNAMIC
	

WHEN SHOULD VIEW BE USED:
-SHOW A SELECTION OF DATA FOR A GIVEN TABLE >>> OMIT SENSITIVE DATA
-COMBINE TABLES IN MEANINGFUL WAYS
-SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO DATA >>> GRANTING ACCESS TO VIEW W/O GRANTING ACESS TO UNDERLYING DATA/TABLES

SYNTAX:
CREATE VIEW <VIEW NAME> (<COLUMN_ALIAS1>, <COLUMN_ALIAS2>, ...<COLUMN_N>)
   AS SELECT <COLUMN_1>, <COLUMN_2>,...<COLUMN_N>
   FROM <TABLE NAME>
   WHERE <CONDITION>;
>>>CAN USE WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING BUT NOT ORDER BY
