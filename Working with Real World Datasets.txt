Working with Real World Datasets
=====================================================================================================
-CSV: txt files which contain data values seperated by commas or semicolons
-attribute labels(id,name,department, etc) map to column labels
-CSV files can have a header row that contains names of attributes
	-default colums names may not be DB or query friendly
	-DB parser assumes uppercase names by default
-Use double quotes"" to specify mixed-case columns names
-By default spaces are mapped as underscores
	-name of dog >>> name_of_dog
	-special characters like () or [] may also get mapped as _
-Using quotes in JPnotebook:
	-assign queries to variables
		 selectQuert = 'select "Id" from dogs'
	-use \ in cases where the query contains single quotes: 
		selectQuery= 'select * from dogs where "name_of_dog" = \'huggy\'
-splitting queries into multiple lines in JP:
	-use \ to split query into multiple line
		%sql select "Id", "name_of_dog", \
		From dogs
		where "name_of_dog"= 'huggy'
	-Or use %%sql in the 1st row of the cell in notebook:
		%%sql
		select "Id", "name_of_dog",
		from dogs
		where "name_of_dog" = "huggy"
-restricting the #of rows retrieved
	-select # from census_data limit 3
